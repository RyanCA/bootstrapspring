Try to put the sql Connector/Driver in the tomcat/lib and not in the war. 
Because every time you deploy the war the connector/driver will be created 
sometimes the garbage collector cant remove them which will ends in a memory 
leak. So try to move the connector on the tomcat/lib folder.

So put mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar into apache-tomcat-8.0.3\lib
